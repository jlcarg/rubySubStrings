The Odin Project - Ruby - Project: Sub Strings

This is the second project from the Ruby course within The Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Path. The program takes a phrase and a dictionary of valid substrings as input, then returns a hash containing the substrings that were found in the given phrase, along with the count of how many times each substring appears.

## Project Requirements

- Implement a method #substrings that takes a phrase or single word as first argument and a dictionary of valid substrings as the second argument
- Return a hash listing each substring(case insensitive) that was found in the first argument and how many times it was found

## Practiced skills

* **Ruby foundational skills:**
    - Arrays
    - Hashes
    - Basic Enumerable Methods
    - Conditionals

## About The Odin Project

> The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.
